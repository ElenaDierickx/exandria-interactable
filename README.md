# Exandrie Interactable

A repository for the Interactable map I made with the use of [Open-Source Exandria](https://github.com/RossThorn/open-source-exandria).

## About

Using the map of [Open-Source Exandria](https://github.com/RossThorn/open-source-exandria) I'm making an interactive map.
The plan is to be able to use this map in your Exandria Campaign.

### Huge credits to RedGiantMaps for making the map
